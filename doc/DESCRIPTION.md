A simple, intuitive web app for analysing and decoding data without having to deal with complex tools or programming languages. CyberChef encourages both technical and non-technical people to explore data formats, encryption and compression: encode, decode, format data, parse data, encrypt, decrypt, compress data, extract data, perform arithmetic functions against data, etc.. There are around 300 operations in CyberChef allowing you to carry out simple and complex tasks easily.

### Why
Digital data comes in all shapes, sizes and formats in the modern world â€“ CyberChef helps to make sense of this data all on one easy-to-use platform.

### How
The interface is designed with simplicity at its heart. Complex techniques are now as trivial as drag-and-drop. Simple functions can be combined to build up a "recipe", potentially resulting in complex analysis, which can be shared with other users and used with their input.
CyberChef being entirely client-side, it should be noted that none of your recipe configuration or input (either text or files) is ever sent to the CyberChef web server - all processing is carried out within your browser, on your own computer.

### Who
It is expected that CyberChef will be useful for cybersecurity and antivirus companies. It should also appeal to the academic world and any individuals or companies involved in the analysis of digital data, be that software developers, analysts, mathematicians or casual puzzle solvers.
